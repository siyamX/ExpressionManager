# Expression Manager ✨

Save and copy your favorite After Effects expressions without switching to Notepad.

## About

I'm a video editor who got tired of switching to Notepad every time I needed an expression. Couldn't find a good extension for this, so I built one myself. I'm not a programmer, so the code might be messy, but it works! Feel free to modify it or suggest features—it's completely open source.

## Extension Not Showing?

After Effects needs a registry edit to show unsigned extensions.
